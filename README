Impressionist is conceptualized and developed by Harish Sivaramakrishnan (@hsivaram) and is under open development on github. Please feel free to watch / fork / log issues.

DEVELOPMENT NOTES 

The current version is alpha 3

The MASTER branch contains an early preview build of impressionist. Please sync to this branch if you are planning to work on stuff. The active development will continue on another branch, and will be merged to this from time to time. 

The alpha preview is hosted at http://www.hsivaram.com/impressionist/alpha3 This is currently webkit only. Please use google chrome or safari to run the app. This has not been tested to a great deal on windows (blame it on me having only a mac) and I expect to find more issues on win than on mac. Please do log issues / feature requests in the issues section
